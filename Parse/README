The scripts in this directory have been tested on the w205 Spring AMI
with anaconda2 python. 

parse_gtfsrt.py parses GTFS-RT updates into CSV files. 

(Ensure python comes from anaconda2 in your PATH variable. 
To install protoc under Centos, i.e. w205 instance, follow
instructions here: http://tech.yipp.ca/linux/install-google-protocol-buffers-linux/
To install python bindings, also run "conda install protobuf")

shell> protoc --python_out=./ gtfs-realtime.proto
shell> protoc --python_out=./ nyct-subway.proto
shell> export MTA_KEY=<your key>
shell> ./parse_gtfsrt.py

Once you have tested parse_gtfsrt.py works ok:


1. execute hive -f ./hive_ddl.sql. It creates tables in the default database in hive 
   and assumes the directory structure to be /user/w205/mta/trip_update/ etc.

2. execute ./gtfsrt_updates.sh from the same directory as ./parse_gtfsrt.py
   

Additional notes on parse_gtfsrt.py:

1. Basic support for arrival and departure delay jitter. 

2. Options are (in order of priority so use only one of them at a time):
   
   -dp:  Adds different amounts of positive jitter to arrival and departure times. 
   -dps: Adds the same amount of random jitter to arrival and departure times. 
   -dn:  Adds different amounts of negative jitter to arrival and departure times. 
   -dns: Adds same amount amount of negative jitter to arrival and departure times. 
   -dm:  Adds different amounts of positive or negative jitter to train times.  

3. You can change the bounds on jitter by changing the value of MAX_JITTER at the top of 
   the parse_gtfsrt.py script. Sorry, i should support a command line option for this, but no
   time. It is currently set to 60 secs.
